### Description

This is a game i wrote in Visual Basic 6.

Its the first game ive ever worked hard on, yet a long way from done and still very small there are still things you do to keep your VBuddy alive.

He can live to a ripe old age of 76 or untill his health gets to 0 (Done in many ways).

At then end it will give you a rank of how good/bad you were to your VBuddy.

Please post feedback!

This was tested with VB 6.0 and Windows XP.

Tell me of bugs you find.
